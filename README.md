# SmartPass

## Overview

**SmartPass** is an event ticketing, check-in, and hosting service designed to streamline everyday routines. Gone are the days of forgetten tickets, and say goodbye to clumsily fumbling around with papers and cards. You are your own ticket – all you need to do is register ahead of time with a picture of your stunning visage and a single word that can be used to confirm your identity. Whether used for concerts, public transportation, or more, SmartPass helps to eliminate long lines and allows all of us to experience more of what matters most.
SmartPass uses Microsoft's Cognitive Services FaceAPI to detect and identify people based on facial features; we have also made use of the Speech framework recently released alongside iOS 10.

## How to Use SmartPass

### Before Heading Out
For users, register for an event online, upload a picture of your face, and tell us your favorite word. Congrats, you're all set!

For hosts, create an event and distribute event IDs to those interested in attending. The app will take care of checking in on site.

### On the Go
If you've registered for an event or purchased a spot on the bus ahead of time, it's as easy as strolling right in. Facial recognition will check you in, and if the algorithm's confidence level is less than satisfactory, you may be prompted to say your key word to confirm your place.

## Why is this Important?
Time is the most valuable resource. In bustling cities, seconds add up on buses and subways, and it's best to clear your mind


## Future Directions
Saved user profiles – disk persistence using Realm.
SmartPass would become an even more powerful tool by enabling users to pay for events or services in advance.
